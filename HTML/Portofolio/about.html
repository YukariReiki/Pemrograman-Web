                    My name is Muhammad Ilham Yumar, and I have been playing and modding games since 5th grade. I have been experimenting with Valve's GoldSource Engine games such as Half-Life, Day Of Defeat, and Counter-Strike. 
                    <br>
                    I know a bit about the game's C++ Source code but I mostly work with the Game's Third Party Plugin AmxMod X scripting language, which is based on the PAWN language, and I enjoy using the Engine's Level Editor, "Valve Hammer Editor."       
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also know how to create waypoints for community-made CPU players such as PODBot, YAPB, SYPB, and EBot.
                    <br>
                    I'm familiar with working on dedicated servers, specifically for Counter-Strike, as I used to configure local servers for myself and my friends to play with bots back when LAN parties were popular. 
                    <br>
                    With this knowledge, many of my friends on Discord often ask me to set up their servers for playing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also had basic knowledge of Local Networking and Desktop Assembly and Maintenance.
